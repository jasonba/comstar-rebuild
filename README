README file for the COMSTAR rebuild scripts
===========================================

This package contains a number of scripts that may aid in the rebuilding of
a COMSTAR configuration from a NexentaStor appliance, in the event of a 
catastrophic configuration failure.

###
### DISCLAIMER
###
### These scripts are provided as-is, with no warranty and no guarantee of
### success.
### They are intended as a "best efforts / heroic recovery" option when all
### other, officially documented backup/recovery methods have been exhausted.
###
### As the owner/maintainer of the appliance, it is your responsibility to
### keep known good backups of critical system configuration details.
### If all else has failed, these scripts may be able to assist on a best
### efforts basis, assuming a recent Collector or Support bundle is available.

Introduction
------------
There are several steps involved in configuring a COMSTAR setup, typically:

o) Setting up the initiator
o) Providing some block level storage (zvol or LUN)
o) Mapping this to logical unit, possibly with a pretermined GUID
o) Optionally configuring the target portal groups
o) Optionally setting up a host group and target group
o) Managing an iSCSI view so the LU can be seen by the initiators

Over a period of time, with lots of LU's and lots of views, the setup can
become very complex.  
Thus it is very important to have a backup of the COMSTAR configuration just
in case something very bad happens to it.



Official COMSTAR Backup/Restore
-------------------------------
The NexentaStor appliance has a method for backing up the COMSTAR config

Backup
~~~~~~
nmc@hobbes:/$ setup iscsi config save 
STMF configuration successfully saved to /var/lib/nza/comstar/backup/stmf.config
ISCSI target configuration successfully saved to /var/lib/nza/comstar/backup/iscsi.config

As you can see this creates two config files, which can be used to restore the
configuration.


Restore
~~~~~~~
nmc@hobbes:/$ setup iscsi config restore
All Configurations including mappings, host groups, target groups, targets and initiators would be destroyed and recreated from the dump file. Do you wish to Proceed :

It is also possible to restore the configuration from one machine to the other in
a clustered setup, using the restore-to or restore-from commands:

nmc@hobbes:/$ setup iscsi config <TAB>
restore       restore-from  restore-to


It would be sensible to copy these files to an external system, such that in
the event of a disaster, you still have access to the COMSTAR configuration
backups.
Furthermore it makes sense to:

o) Take copies of these (from bash) before making any significant COMSTAR change
o) Regularly create a backup



Unofficial COMSTAR Backup/Restore
---------------------------------

The COMSTAR details are stored with the SMF repository for the stmf service.
Thus to take a backup it is possible to do the following:

Backup
~~~~~~
# svccfg export -a svc:/system/stmf > /var/tmp/stmf.manifest.export


Restore
~~~~~~~
Restoring is a simple matter of importing the saved manifest+config data and
then restarting the svc:/system/stmf:default service:

# svccfg import /var/tmp/stmf.manifest.export
# svcadm restart svc:/system/stmf:default

However, what if you don't have a backup of the svc:/system/stmf:default service
manifest?




Collector/Support Bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If all official methods of COMSTAR configuration recovery have been exhausted,
you are *STRONGLY* advised to log a call with Nexenta Support before going any
further.
Proceeding without a support ticket and Nexenta engineer, may result in further
complications and irrevocable damage to the configuration.


Assuming you didn't take a backup of the COMSTAR configuration using the nmc,
or even from the expert mode/bash prompt, then you may still be able to rebuild
the configuration *IF* you have a Collector/Support bundle from the appliance.
Naturally the more recent the Collector/Support bundle the better as any 
modifications made after the Collector was captured would not have been recorded 
anywhere.

################################################################################

NOTE:
  The rebuild scripts do not automatically rebuild the COMSTAR configuration!
  They merely output the underlying, expert mode commands that must be run
  by the administrator in order to rebuild the configuration.

  As things may go wrong or produce unexpected results, you are *STRONGLY*
  encouraged to take the output from the scripts and run each section in turn
  making a note of any errors or warnings and if required, addressing those.

  In particular if you have been using CHAP authentication for any LUs then you
  will be required to manually enter the password/secret phrase.
  If you did not document/keep a record of CHAP users/keys, then rebuilding the
  config with a new key, will require you to re-key your initiators.

################################################################################



In order to attempt a rebuild you will need:

o) A copy of the scripts from the comstar-rebuild.tar.gz file
o) A Collector or Support bundle

Copy these to the appliance, eg:

# mkdir /var/tmp/comstar-rebuild
# cd /var/tmp/comstar-rebuild
# wget <URL-for-comstar-rebuild.tar.gz>
# tar zxvf comstar-rebuild.tar.gz

Now extract the collector or support bundle, ensuring we have the comstar directory.

# tar xvf collector.tar.gz
...
comstar/
comstar/echo-stmf_trace_bufs-mdb-k.stats
comstar/itadm-list-tpg-v.out
comstar/iscsiadm-list-isns-server-v.stats
	...
(truncated for brevity)


Usage
-----
Usage: comstar-rebuild.sh [-h] [-C] [-c <collector_location>/comstar ] [ -b <support_bundle_location>/comstar ] [ -i <initiator_chap_secret> ] [ -t <target_chap_secret> [-v]


Once done, run the comstar-rebuild.sh script ensuring you point it to the 
comstar directory.
Owing to some naming convention differences, you'll need to say whether you're
using a collector (use the -c switch) or a bundle (use the -b switch), eg:

Collector
---------
# ./comstar-rebuild.sh -c machine_name/comstar


Support Bundle
--------------
# ./comstar-rebuild.sh -b bundle_name/collector/comstar


Cluster Support
---------------
If you're rebuilding the COMSTAR configuration for a clustered system, you
should specify the -C switch, which will tell the scripts to use 'stmfha'
to build the configuration, ensuring this is replicated between cluster
nodes.

For example:

Collector
---------
# ./comstar-rebuild.sh -C -c collector_name/comstar


CHAP Secrets
------------
The COMSTAR configuration may use a CHAP secret for both initiator and target.
You can specify these using the -i <initiator_secret> and -t <target_secret>
switches.

For example:

# ./comstar-rebuild.sh -i darmok -t jalad -c collector_name/comstar



Example Output
--------------

It will produce output of the following type:

----------------------------------- EXAMPLE ------------------------------------


The output will *NOT* recreate any COMSTAR configuration, merely supply the 
commands that must then be run at the bash prompt, in order to rebuild it.

As documented above in the NOTE section you are *STRONGLY* encouraged to take
the output from the scripts and run each section in turn making a note of any
errors or warnings and if required, addressing those.

If there are any errors that cannot be simply resolved (eg: typo, wrong name),
then STOP!
Consult the Nexenta engineer for further advise.



Addendum
--------
The following scripts are supplied in the comstar-rebuild.sh
Ideally the comstar-rebuild.sh script will run each module in turn, supplying the
output that then needs to be run manually and this will happen without errors.

However if an error does occur it is possible to run each module/perl script 
individually so that the output can be examined for possible parsing errors of
the comstar data, which can then be addressed.


o) comstar-rebuild.sh
   - The main script that calls each sub-routine perl script in order

o) create-initiator.pl
   - The script to recreate the initiator configuration

o) create-lu.pl
   - The script to recreate the logical unit (LU) configuration

o) tpg.pl
   - Creates the target portal group configuration

o) target.pl
   - The script to recreate the targets configuration

o) hg.pl
   - The script to recreate the host groups configuration

o) tg.pl
   - The script to recreate the target groups configuration

o) views.pl
   - The script to recreate the iSCSI views configuration

If so required, you may run each sub-routine manually, eg:

# ./create-lu.pl <data_filename>

Should you not know which data file to supply to the script, running it
without arguments will tell you, eg:

# ./create-lu.pl
Usage: create-lu.pl stmfadm-list-lu-v.out
